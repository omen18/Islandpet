## ✦ What is IslandPet?

Most productivity apps treat you like a machine — track hours, hit targets, move on. **IslandPet flips that entirely.**

At its core, IslandPet is a **virtual companion system** woven into your iPhone's Dynamic Island. Every Pomodoro session you complete feeds your pet — giving it XP, unlocking new traits, triggering evolutions. Skip sessions and your companion gets sleepy. Stay consistent and it thrives.

It's not gamification for the sake of it. It's **emotional design as productivity infrastructure.**

```
Focus Session → XP Earned → Pet Reacts → Streak Grows → Evolution Unlocked
     ↑                                                           ↓
     └─────────────────── You come back again ──────────────────┘
```

<br/>

---

## ✦ Core Features

<br/>

### 🧠 Focus Engine

| Feature | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Session Style** | Pomodoro-based (customizable durations) |
| **XP System** | Every minute of focus = earned growth |
| **Progression** | Long-arc evolution mechanics, not just daily resets |
| **Streak Logic** | Freeze protection, daily continuity tracking |

<br/>

### 🐾 The Pet System

Your companion isn't static — it's a **living state machine** with memory.

```
States:         😄 Happy  →  😴 Sleepy  →  💤 Idle  →  ✨ Evolving
Triggers:       Focus     →  Rest       →  Neglect  →  Milestone
Personality:    Trait-based, deterministic, consistent across sessions
Memory:         Responds differently based on your history with it
```

No AI black boxes. No randomness. Just a **well-designed personality engine** that feels alive because it was *designed* to feel alive.

### 📍 Dynamic Island Integration

This is where IslandPet gets wild.

> **Your pet doesn't just live in the app — it lives in your phone.**

During focus sessions, your companion takes up residence in the Dynamic Island:

- 🟢 **Compact view** — pet animation + session timer
- 🔔 **Notification view** — pet reaction to your action
- 📲 **Expanded view** — full session controls + pet mood
- ⏹️ **Quick stop** — tap to end session right from the island

Built with **ActivityKit** + **WidgetKit**. Real system-level integration, not a workaround.

<br/>

### 🎬 Evolution Cinematic

When your pet evolves, it doesn't just level up silently.

It gets a **full-screen cinematic moment:**

- Particle burst effects
- Layered motion animations
- Haptic feedback choreography
- **Shareable 1080×1920 story-ready export**

Because milestones should *feel* like milestones.

<br/>

### 📊 Streak & Retention Intelligence

```
Daily Heatmap      →  See your consistency at a glance
Smart Notifications →  Pet-driven reminders ("I miss you...")  
Freeze Logic       →  Life happens — your streak is protected
Reaction System    →  Pet responds to patterns, not just sessions
```

## ✦ Design Philosophy

IslandPet is built on three principles — and they aren't negotiable:

<br/>

```
1. Emotional Attachment  >  Feature Count
   ─────────────────────────────────────
   One thing that makes you feel something beats ten things
   that do nothing. Every feature earns its place.

2. Polish  >  Complexity
   ─────────────────────────────────────
   The animation that runs at 120fps matters.
   The haptic that fires at exactly the right moment matters.
   Details are the product.

3. Experience  >  Utility
   ─────────────────────────────────────
   IslandPet doesn't just help you focus.
   It makes you want to.
```

<br/>

The design language — **glassmorphism + gradient-based surfaces + custom motion system** — is built to feel like it belongs on an Apple product page. Because if it doesn't look like it belongs there, it's not done yet.

## ✦ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```bash
# You'll need:
Xcode 15+
iOS 17+ device or simulator
Apple Developer Account (required for Live Activities)
```

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/IslandPet.git
cd IslandPet
open IslandPet.xcodeproj
```

### Run

```
1. Select a target device (iPhone 14 Pro or newer for Dynamic Island)
2. Sign with your Apple Developer team
3. Build & Run (⌘R)
```

> ⚠️ **Live Activities and Dynamic Island require a physical device.** The simulator won't cut it for the full experience.

## ✦ Roadmap

<br/>

```
v1.0 — MVP (Current)
├── ✅ Core focus & Pomodoro engine
├── ✅ Pet state + personality system  
├── ✅ Dynamic Island live integration
├── ✅ XP & streak tracking
└── ✅ Evolution cinematic

v1.1 — Polish Arc
├── 🎨 Custom pet illustrations (replacing procedural sprites)
├── 💳 StoreKit 2 (cosmetics + premium features)
└── ☁️  iCloud sync across devices

v1.2 — Social Arc
├── 👥 Co-focus sessions (focus with friends)
├── 🎭 Advanced pet personalization
└── 🎞️  Rive animation integration (fluid, interactive sprites)
```

<br/>

---

## ✦ Inspiration

IslandPet stands on the shoulders of apps that proved emotional design works:

| App | What It Proved |
|-----|---------------|
| **Duolingo** | Streak psychology is incredibly powerful |
| **Finch** | Users form real emotional bonds with digital companions |
| **Forest** | Productivity + a reason to care = habit formation |

But none of them combined **habit formation + emotional design + system-level iOS integration.**

That's the gap IslandPet fills.

## ✦ Vision

<div align="center">

<br/>

*IslandPet is not just an app.*  
*It's an attempt to redefine what productivity feels like.*

<br/>

```
From  discipline  →  to  attachment
From  tracking    →  to  caring
From  streaks     →  to  stories
```

<br/>

**The goal isn't to make you more productive.**  
**It's to make you someone who shows up — because something is waiting for you.**
